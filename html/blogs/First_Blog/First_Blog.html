					<p>My name is Logan Smylie and I am a Security Researcher with an intrest in RE, Networking, and hardware hacking<br> I will be starting off my journey in this blogging sphere with a 100 days of code series. I will primarily use Python and C, but also get into assembly code. The reason for everything that I upload is so that I can learn new things as well as being able to share it with the world.<br> A follow on my socials would be greatly appreciated as I look to grow and become a more skilled (ethical) hacker!</p>
